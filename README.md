### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving 2 solo projects I did for the Le Wagon web dev bootcamp
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and algoritms by doing coding challenges and following a course in algorithms

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like participating in game jams both as an illustrator and a programmer (❁´◡`❁)
